Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++
This project contains an implementation of a doubly linked list in C++. The doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a pointer to the previous and the next element.

Features
Insertion: Supports insertion of elements at the beginning of the list.
Deletion: Allows deletion of elements from the list.
Traversal: Provides methods to traverse the list both in forward and reverse directions.
